##  Story

Recently, many schools have started implementing online teaching modes due to the impact of the pandemic. In our school, we use 酷克Cloud in conjunction with Google Meet for each online class. Teachers pre-place the Google Meet link on 酷克Cloud, and when it's time for class, students must log in to Google Meet and open the link to start the session. This has given rise to several issues:

    1. 酷克Cloud often becomes inaccessible to students due to a sudden surge in traffic.
    2. The operation of 酷克Cloud is overly complex, leading students to frequently forget the steps.
    3. Before attending classes, students must check their schedules to determine which course to join.

The above-mentioned problems have spurred my determination to create an automatic online system.
